# RentalHouse
**Rental House Identification System (Front-end) (HTML, CSS, JS)**

**Project Description:**
People are roaming here and there to find rental houses with theirexpectation and their fixed budget. If a person gets a job at Chennai, he/she is not staying there permanently and buying a house is a commitment of time and money, and with the average job currently lasting 4.6 years (less if you’re younger), he/she might get through 10 jobs in a lifetime. For that he/she will be in need of some rented houses and renting gives flexibility. So, by this website, we can able to find those houses instantly without roaming. Also, students from various towns come to other city for pursuing higher studies. 97% of students are bachelors and they need a house to live in. But the main problem is that getting a house for rent is lengthy and it takes a long time to be processed. Most families choose to rent houses based on their income and family situations. Unfortunately, there may not be enough good quality rental housing for these families. The demand for rental houses is extremely high and more rental houses need to be put in place. The purpose of the project is to find the rented house instantly in a given location. House agents are acting as an intermediate to get rental and homes for sale. In order to avoid this, we have suggested this project.
